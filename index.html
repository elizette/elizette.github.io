      <h2>How to handle Bleep</h2>
      <p>To handle Bleep you will need three things: patience,love, and cleanig skills.
        Heres why Bleep is a brat. His world revolves around him and you are just living in it.So to put up with his attitude and demands you will need patience.
        Bleep also requires love, and lots of it. IF he feels he has not been shown the proper affections, he will not be afraid to let you know. He will meow at you untill you prove your affections with scratches.
        The last major requirment is cleaning skillsbecause Bleep is a mess. He constantly tips over water bowls and knocks things off counters for fun. You are the one that will have to clean it.

      <h2>His Day</h2>
      <p>Life in the day of bleep. 
        His day starts off by meowing untill someone feeds him his breakfeast.
         Wich he then eats promptly. 
         After this he will try to steal food from your breakfeast.
          Next he will be outside soaking in the sun and napping for hours.
           This is where the majority of his day is spent.
            After he has slept his fill, he will go back inside to be iritated by his playful roomate the dog.
             Next will be his dinner. Followed by trying to steal your food once more. 
             Then finally he will cozy up in your warm spot on the couch while you are up getting something to drink.   </p>
